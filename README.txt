Solution__Autoregression_Analysis.pdf/tex/lyx:
    This contains a discussion of approach to the problem, beginning with the math, 
      and continuing on to the data analysis.
    (Aside: LyX is a WYSIWYG version of LaTeX, which I use almost like a scripting)


The Code:
I aranged the code to follow the Box-Jenkins method for analyzing a timeseries.

Check_Stationary.py is used to check if a timeseries looks to be stationary.
    It contains a single script-like function for breaking a timeseries into slices, and
      plotting the average, variance, and autocorrelations of the different pieces.

TimeSeriesStats.py contains the functions for analyzing a timeseries in more depth, 
    and picking model order. It contains a function for calculating the ACF, PACF, AR-coefficients,
      and error of the predictions of an AR model.
    When __main__() is run, it does all of these for a dataset, which is either
      generated by make_AR_TS, or read in from a file.

Fit_AR_Model_and_Make_Predictions.py is a script to use one the model order is chosen.
    It fits the model to "insampledata.csv" and generates the predictions
      for the sequences in "outsampledata.csv", then writes them to "predicteddata.csv"
    The prediction for the variance of the noise is printed to the screen.

make_AR_TS.py generates a time series for an autoregressive model of specified order
    error amplitude. 


DownloadFinancialData.py is just an example of a way to obtain data for analysis.
